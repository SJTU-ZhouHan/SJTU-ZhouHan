Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). As one of the most disturbing symptoms, mechanical allodynia (MA) in PDPN remains largely unexplored. 

The file "scRNA-seq analysis for PDPN.R" contains the bioinformatics analysis codes for a single-cell sequencing study about PDPN. Sequencing samples were obtained from the L5 dorsal root ganglion of diabetic rats with or without MA. The relevant sequencing data can be found through GEO-NCBI (GSE176017). In this analysis, the main R packages we used include Seurat, monocle, SCENIC, and CellChat.
